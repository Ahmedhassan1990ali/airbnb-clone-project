---

### 4. Reviews
Feedback from guests after staying at a property.

- `id`: Unique identifier

- `property_id`: Foreign key referencing the property
- `rating`: Numeric score (e.g., 1–5)
- `comment`: Optional review message

**Relationships**:
- A review is written by one user.
- A review is for one property.

---

### 5. Payments
Records of successful transactions.

- `id`: Unique identifier

- `amount`: Total payment amount
- `payment_method`: e.g., credit card, PayPal
- `status`: e.g., pending, completed, faileds

**Relationships**:
- A payment belongs to one booking.

## 🔐 API Security

Security is a top priority in this application to ensure user trust, data integrity, and safe financial transactions. The following measures are implemented to secure the API:

### 1. Authentication
- **Method**: Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT or DRF Token Authentication).
- **Purpose**: Verifies the identity of users before granting access to protected endpoints.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing or manipulating user accounts and sensitive operations like booking or payment.

### 2. Authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Hosts can manage properties they own.
  - Guests can book and review but not modify other users’ data.
  - Admins have elevated access for moderation and oversight.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures users can only perform actions they’re allowed to, minimizing risk of data leaks or privilege abuse.

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Strategy**: Limit the number of API requests per user/IP over time.
- **Why it matters**: Protects against brute-force attacks, denial-of-service (DoS), and abuse of public APIs.

### 4. Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: Sensitive fields like passwords are hashed and stored securely.
- **In Transit**: HTTPS is enforced for all data transmission between client and server.
- **Why it matters**: Prevents data theft during storage or network interception.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Method**: All user inputs are validated using serializers and sanitized where needed.
- **Why it matters**: Protects against injection attacks (SQL, XSS) and ensures data consistency.

### 6. Secure Payments
- **Integration with third-party payment gateways** (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) using their secure APIs.
- **Why it matters**: Ensures that financial data is not stored or mishandled by the application, reducing liability and risk.

---

These security practices are essential for:
- 🔒 Protecting **user data** (emails, passwords, profile info)
- 💳 Securing **payment operations**
- 🏠 Safeguarding **property and booking details**
- 🛡️ Preventing **unauthorized access** or service abuse

## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It ensures that changes to the codebase are integrated smoothly and delivered quickly, reliably, and safely.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically tests and integrates new code when changes are pushed to the repository.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploys the tested code to a staging or production environment.

---

### Why CI/CD is Important
- ✅ **Faster Development Cycles**: Automates repetitive steps, allowing developers to focus on building features.
- 🧪 **Improved Code Quality**: Ensures all changes are tested automatically before merging or deployment.
- 🚀 **Reliable Deployments**: Reduces human error by automating deployment steps.
- 🔄 **Consistent Environments**: Helps maintain uniformity across dev, staging, and production environments.

---

### Tools Used for CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for testing, building, and deploying the application directly from GitHub.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for consistent environment setup and easy deployment.
- **Docker Hub / GitHub Container Registry**: Hosts container images used for deployment.
- **Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean (Optional)**: Deployment platforms that can integrate with CI/CD tools.

---

> By implementing a CI/CD pipeline, this project ensures smooth and secure delivery of new features and bug fixes with minimal downtime.
